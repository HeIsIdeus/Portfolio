Information
===============================

A JavaScript website I built from scratch for showcasing all of my Ruby and JavaScript projects. Developed in CSS3,
HTML5, normalize.css, responsive.css.

There is no backend included in the build thus far. It is simply a fully-responsive
"mobile first" front-end website using the lastest HTML5 / CSS3 web-based 
technologies.

The website is not 100% finished. It's an Alpha version and there's room for a ton of improvements,
optimizations, etc. 

Purpose
===============================
The main purpose of this website is to try to make a simple, yet effective
way to showcase my development portfolio using some cool new technologies.
I needed to make a quick working version to showcase my working knowledge and 
development skill set.

Thus far, my background has been HTML5 & CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby, node.js 
using Express and Rails for MVC frameworks, plus relational and non-relational
databases using postgreSQL and Mongo DB. 

Technologies
==============================
normalize.js is an exciting cross-platform utility that targets Windows, Mac, 
Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, HTML5. Its genius as a utility is in delivering consistency,
customization accross all major browsers.

Google API for accessing the customized fonts used to integrate fonts that are more
asthetically pleasing for UI / UX.

responsive.css is a file containing the code that makes this website
a "mobile-first" design. Please visit // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
// for a more detailed explanation. Responsive design is a technique that 
makes my website content seamless across all browser types (mobile, iPad-like, laptop, desktop, etc.).
