Information
===============================

A JavaScript website I built from scratch to use for showcasing all of my web projects. Developed in CSS3,
HTML5, normalize.js

There is no backend included in the build thus far. It is simply a fully-responsive
"mobile first" front-end website using the lastest HTML5 / CSS3 web-based 
technologies.

The website is not 100% finished. It's a first version and there's room for a ton of improvements,
optimizations, etc. 

Purpose
===============================
The main purpose of this website is to try to make a simple, yet effective
way to showcase my development portfolio using some cool new technologies.

Thus far, my background has been HTML5 & CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby, node.js 
using Express and Rails for MVC frameworks, plus relational and non-relational
databases using MongoDB and postgreSQL. I needed to make a quick
working version to showcase that knowledge.

Technologies
==============================
normalize.js is an exciting cross-platform utility that targets Windows, Mac, 
Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, HTML5. Its genius as a utility is in delivering consistency,
customization accross all major browsers.

Google API for accessing the customized fonts used to create a more
asthetically pleasing UI.

responsive.css is a file containing the code that makes this website
a "mobile-first" design. Please visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
for a detailed explaination. This is a technique that makes my website content 
seamless across all browsers (mobile, iPad-like, laptop, desktop, etc.).
