A JavaScript website I built from scratch to use for showcasing all of my web projects. 

===========================

There is no backend included in the build thus far. It is simply a fully-responsive
"mobile first" front-end website using the lastest HTML5 / CSS3 web-based 
technologies.

===========================

This website includes the following software dependencies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Normalize.js and Responsive.js JavaScript libraries
- Google API's for font style
